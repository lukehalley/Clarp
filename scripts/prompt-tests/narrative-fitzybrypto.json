  "theStory": "Fitzybrypto, real name likely Fitzy, runs a verified X account with 8,435 followers, branding himself with a humorous bio: 'PhD in retard communication helping the lower IQ understand how things work. Posts are not financial advice.' Active in the Solana meme coin ecosystem, his content blends degen humor, simple crypto explanations, and token promotions. Early activity in June-July 2025 shows casual engagement, like replying in threads with quips (e.g., June 4, 2025: 'What do women love?' in a meme context, https://x.com/Fitzybrypto/status/1930364250070909024) and openly 'pumping bags' on July 25, 2025 ('Im busy pumping my bags', https://x.com/Fitzybrypto/status/1948866955965804781), indicating a trader mindset without specific projects highlighted.\n\nBy late 2025 and into January 2026, Fitzy evolved into a community leader, particularly with $BOOB, a boob-themed meme coin. On January 19, 2026, he addressed rumors of a Community Takeover (CTO), calling buyers 'retarded pigs' for front-running but proceeded to CTO after the original team allegedly exploited Keep A Breast charity ('Ok fuck it ctoing $boob', https://x.com/Fitzybrypto/status/2014377042528153876). He ramped up boob memes, like January 26's 'We must protect boob at all costs' (https://x.com/Fitzybrypto/status/2015755631609721292), driving engagement. The charity endorsed him positively on January 23 ('@Fitzybrypto is the guy', https://x.com/keepabreast/status/2014648937190228342), boosting legitimacy.\n\nHis reputation is mixed: praised as transparent and capable by supporters for leading multi-million mcap CTOs previously, but criticized for potential pump/dumps. On January 23, amid charity bullishness ('Breast cancer charity bullish...', https://x.com/Fitzybrypto/status/2014789214060138924), @Pokepal007 accused him of fresh wallets and pump/dump risks. No major rugs or exits noted; he critiques others like James Wynn on January 11 (https://x.com/Fitzybrypto/status/2010170602074849785). Overall, he's a niche degen voice, evolving from casual shiller to CTO leader.",
