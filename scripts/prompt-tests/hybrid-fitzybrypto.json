  "theStory": "@Fitzybrypto is a Solana-focused degen trader and content creator known for his blunt, no-nonsense style and heavy promotion of privacy-focused projects like $ZERA from ZeraLabs. Emerging prominently in early 2025, he gained traction by calling out market manipulations and advising degens on trenches survival, as seen in his Jan 31, 2025 post criticizing tech founders for misunderstanding degen dynamics (https://x.com/Fitzybrypto/status/1885471731827015785). By mid-2025, he shifted to aggressive shilling of $ZERA, positioning it as Solana's top privacy play ahead of narratives like $ZEC, with posts like Sep 30, 2025 highlighting its visionary edge (https://x.com/Fitzybrypto/status/1973153772873588769). Controversies are minimal, though some accuse him of shilling rugs; no evidence found of personal rugs. Recently, on Jan 26, 2026, he CTO'd $BOOB after its team rugged, aligning it with breast cancer charity Keep A Breast for positive sentiment (https://x.com/Fitzybrypto/status/2015578806975668289). His reputation is solid among Solana degens for authenticity, evolving from critic to community leader.",
