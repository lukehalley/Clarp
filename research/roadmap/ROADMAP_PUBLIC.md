# $CLARP Roadmap

the first autonomous trust pilot. detecting rugpulls before retail loses money.

---

## what we've shipped

### CLARP Terminal (live)
search any solana token. get a trust score with evidence.

- **trust score engine** (0-100) with confidence levels
- **OSINT pipeline** - GitHub, X, domain, Telegram, Discord, launchpads
- **X profile scanner** - Grok-powered shill detection
- **GitHub vapourware detector** - AI code detection, commit patterns
- **wallet authentication** - Phantom/Solflare with tier-based access
- **DexScreener integration** - token enrichment
- **entity classification** - projects, people, organizations

try it: [clarp.gg/terminal](https://clarp.gg/terminal)

## what's next

### phase 2: token-gated access + tokenomics (building now)

**100K CLARP to access terminal. no subscriptions. hold the token.**

every buy/sell on bags.fm generates a 1% creator fee. distributed automatically:

- 50% development & growth (features, partnerships, expansion)
- 30% operations (API costs, infra)
- 20% burn (buy CLARP on bags → burn address, daily)

the burn is real. 20% of all fees buy $CLARP and remove it from supply. every tx on solscan

| feature | status |
|---------|--------|
| token-gated access (100K CLARP) | building |
| automated fee distribution | building |
| daily CLARP burn | building |
| tokenomics dashboard | building |

---

### phase 3: staking (q1)

**stake $CLARP. earn fee share.**

**staking tiers:**
| lock period | boost | benefits |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| 7 days | 1.0x | base APY |
| 30 days | 1.5x | higher APY |
| 90 days | 2.0x | maximum APY |

---

### phase 4: bags hackathon (2 weeks)

**CLARP becomes the trust layer for Bags ecosystem**

- trust scores for all Bags tokens
- embedded swap widget (SOL → CLARP)
- full Bags API integration
- automated fee distribution via Bags

makes Bags the safest DEX.

---

### phase 5: rebrand detection (q1/q2)

**same team. new name. we see you.**

- serial rugger database
- team wallet tracking across projects
- KOL accountability tracker
- logo similarity detection

you can rebrand. you can't hide your wallet history.

---

### phase 6: community intel (q2)

**snitch mode. bounties. hall of shame.**

- stake $CLARP to submit intel
- bounties for catching rugs early
- hall of shame archives every rug
- community verification with slashing

| phase | status |

## tokenomics

**token:** $CLARP on Solana
**CA:** `GtwMkjRY8Vi5oGaLaEsd1xnsr3AkZ6ZYBqsG5ipTBAGS`
**DEX:** Bags.fm

**access:** 100K CLARP minimum to use terminal. no subscriptions. hold the token.

**fee distribution:**
```
trading volume → 1% creator fee →
    50% development & growth
    30% operations (API costs, infra)
    20% burn (buy CLARP → burn address, daily)
```

**the loop:**
```
hold CLARP → use terminal → trading = fees →
fees fund ops + burns → supply shrinks →
product improves → more users → more fees → repeat
```

## the mission

trustpilot for crypto.

rugchecker tells you if the contract will drain your wallet.
CLARP tells you if there's anything behind the contract at all.

*this roadmap gets updated. because we actually ship.*

$CLARP
the framework for detecting frameworks that don't exist.
(while actually building things. weird.)
