> **Rules:**
> - Don't reply to the same person twice in a week
> - Don't reply to threads where 50 others are already shilling
> - Hit tweets within 10-15 mins for visibility
> - If someone engages, switch to DMs and use follow-up templates from kol-outreach.md

> - Keep the lowercase energy. no caps, no emojis, no cringe
> - Use line breaks between each point - makes it scannable on mobile

## Dev Openers (rotate these)

Pick a different one each time so your profile reads natural:

1. `im the dev -`
2. `i built this -`
3. `dev here -`
4. `yo i made this -`
5. `this is my project -`
6. `i built clarp -`
7. `dev behind this one -`
8. `building this myself -`
9. `im luke, i built this -`
10. `made this, doxxed dev -`
